a# AI-Bridge: Apply Script Update (AutoHotkey v2)

These steps update your AI-Bridge `.ahk` script safely and confirm it is running afterwards.

## 1) Stop the currently running script
1. Look in the Windows system tray (bottom-right).
   - If you don’t see it, click the `^` hidden icons arrow.
2. Find the green **H** icon (AutoHotkey).
3. Right-click the green **H** icon.
4. Click **Exit**.

## 2) Replace the script contents with the updated code
1. Open your current AI-Bridge script file in Notepad++ (the `.ahk` you normally run).
2. Select all: `Ctrl + A`
3. Paste the new full code block (replaces everything).
4. Save the file: `Ctrl + S`

Recommended naming convention:
- Save as: `AI_bridge_AHK_v10-5.ahk` (or next version)

## 3) Start the updated script
1. In File Explorer, locate your `.ahk` file.
2. Run it:
   - Double-click the `.ahk`, OR
   - Right-click → **Show more options** → **Run with AutoHotkey v2** (if you have multiple AHK versions installed)
3. Confirm the green **H** icon appears in the tray.

## 4) Quick verification (smoke check)
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`
   - You should see a popup confirming the script is running.
2. Copy any text (or a ChatGPT code block), then press `Ctrl + Alt + N`
   - A new file should appear in: `C:\Python\AI-bridge\scratch`
   - Notepad++ should open and the clipboard text should paste into the new file.
3. Press `Ctrl + Alt + L`
   - The log folder should open:
     - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AI-bridge\logs`
   - The file `runs.tsv` should be present and should grow after each run.

## Troubleshooting
- If hotkeys do nothing: the script is not running. Re-run the `.ahk` and confirm the green **H** icon.
- If you see v1-style errors: make sure you run the script with **AutoHotkey v2**.
- If Notepad++ does not open: confirm Notepad++ is installed in a standard path under `Program Files`.
